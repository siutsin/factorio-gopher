# Agent Instructions

## Linting Protocol

Always run `make lint` after editing any Markdown, Lua, Go, or text file and
fix any failures immediately. This runs:

- `markdownlint-cli2` against all `*.md`
- `luacheck` against all `mod/*.lua`
- `golangci-lint` against all Go packages

## Testing

Run `make test` after any code change. This runs:

- `make test-go` with `go test -race -cover ./...`
- `make test-lua` with `busted -c mod/spec` plus luacov coverage

`internal/SetFrameSize` is a test-only seam used by both `TestMain` blocks to
shrink the 1024-px frame to 64-px so integration tests run in seconds rather
than minutes. Production code never calls it.

## Development Loop

Run `make install` once to symlink `mod/` into Factorio's mods folder. Re-run
whenever `version` in `mod/info.json` changes; Factorio identifies mods by
`name_version` folder.

After editing `mod/data-updates.lua` or replacing PNGs in `mod/graphics/`, exit
to the main menu and reopen the save. Sprite changes do not hot-reload.

`make uninstall` removes the symlink. It only acts if the path is a symlink.

## Sprite Modification Policy

**CRITICAL**: Always re-read the base game source before changing sprite
fields. The character schema shifts between Factorio versions.

- Entity definition:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Factorio/`
  `factorio.app/Contents/data/base/prototypes/entity/entities.lua`
  (search `name = "character"`)
- Animation tables: same directory, `character-animations.lua`
- Confirmed against base mod 2.0.76.

### Specific Cases

**Mutate from `data-updates.lua`, not `data.lua`**; the base prototype must
already exist when we mutate it.

**Mutation target**: `data.raw.character.character`. Its `animations` field is
an array of armour-tier sets.
Each set has keys `idle`, `idle_with_gun`, `running`, `running_with_gun`,
`flipped_shadow_running_with_gun`, and `mining_with_tool`, each with a `layers`
list.
Walk every armour set when reskinning.

**Sprite paths** use the `__gopher__/...` prefix to resolve to this mod's
folder.

## Asset Policy

Source files (Blender, Aseprite, references) live in `art/` and are gitignored.
Only files in `mod/` ship.

PNGs only; Factorio does not load WebP. Convert with `dwebp` if needed.

Sprite sources come from <https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-vector>
(CC BY 3.0, Takuya Ueda; credit required).
Download SVGs into `art/`, then rasterise to `mod/graphics/`:

- **Free-standing sprite** (single pose, no matched set): preserve aspect, pad
  horizontally.

  ```bash
  rsvg-convert -h 256 -a art/foo.svg \
    | magick - -background none -gravity center \
      -extent 256x256 mod/graphics/foo.png
  ```

- **Matched directional set** (front + side + back share a canvas): force every
  frame into the same square so they line up in a sheet.

  ```bash
  rsvg-convert -w 256 -h 256 -a art/foo.svg \
    | magick - -background none -gravity center \
      -extent 256x256 mod/graphics/foo.png
  ```

## Tool Selection

- Mod definition: `info.json` for name, version, Factorio version, and deps.
- Prototype mutation: Lua in `data-updates.lua`.
- Sprite assets: PNG files under `mod/graphics/`, with RGBA channels.
- SVG to PNG: `rsvg-convert` to rasterise vector sources.
- PNG canvas and sheets: `magick` to pad, stitch, and mirror frames.
- WebP to PNG: `dwebp` for web source images.
- Install: `make install` to symlink `mod/` into Factorio's mods folder.
